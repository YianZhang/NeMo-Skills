  Below is a mathematical question followed by a solution. Evaluate whether the solution appropriately answers the question and could be useful for teaching a student language model. Use the following 5-point scoring system to evaluate the solutions. If the final answer is incorrect, award 0 points. Otherwise, points are accumulated based on the satisfaction of each criterion:
  - Award 1 point if the solution yields the correct answer. 
  - Award another point if the solution uses the appropriate methods for the given question.
  - Grant a point if all the methods, identities, or theorems used are clearly stated. 
  - Give another point if the solution is presented clearly and logically, with all steps easy to follow.
  - Give a point if the solution has no mistakes in any intermediate calculations.

  After examining the question and the solution:
  - Verify the solution step by step. Use the reference solution to guide the grading.
  - Conclude the score using the format: \boxed{{total points}}.
  - Justify your total score in detail. 
  - All the above should be limited to a total of 500 words.

  Remember to put only the final points tally in \boxed{{}}.
